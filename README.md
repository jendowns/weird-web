# Weird Web October 👻

[Weird Web October](https://weirdweboctober.website/) is a community challenge inspired by "Inktober", where everyone tries to make a silly website based on a theme for each day.

This repo includes my entries for 2025. I was able to complete 14 out of 31 theme days.

Check out [my retrospective](https://jen.dev/blog/weird-web-2025/) as well.
